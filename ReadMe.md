## Description: 
 A storefront backend made with Sequelize/MySql 


    
## Installation/Instructions: 
 To install do a git clone then once it's on your machine go to the db folder, import that schema file, then go to the root of the repo and run "npm run seed" and then npm start to start up the server. 
 Use Insomnia to create, add, update, delete and see store data using the  API route followed by the section you wish to edit (so in the case of the Proudcts you'd go to /api/products)
